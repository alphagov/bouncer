# This repo has a pattern of using doubles to mock DB objects,
# instead of creating them properly in a test DB. Since fields
# of a model like Site are defined dynamically when the records
# are loaded, it's not possible to use "instance_double" to mock
# them - this will lead to an error about a non-existent attribute.
